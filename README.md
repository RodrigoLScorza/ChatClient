# ChatClient
## About this project
An Android chat client for Object-Oriented Programming and Datacommunication course. Earlier on the same course we had an introduction to Object-oriented programming where we created a backend server to handle chatting through console. We then proceeded to create this application as a followup to connect to the same backend but with an android application.
